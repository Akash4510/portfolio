            I am Akash Gupta, a Full Stack Web Developer and a Creative UI-UX
            Designer. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and
            Instrumentation Engineering from Techno Main Saltlake, West Bengal,
            Kolkata. I started my programming journey in 2020 and ever since
            then I love programming. I am a self-taught web developer and I am
            looking for opportunities to work with other developers to learn and
            grow together.
